## Strategy:

### Full-Stack Microservices Architecture Strategy

### 1. Overall Architecture

We will implement a comprehensive microservices architecture for the Virtual Pet application using Spring Cloud for backend services and ReactJS for the frontend. This approach will provide scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

### 2. Core Infrastructure Services

- **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)**: Central entry point for all client requests, handling routing, filtering, and load balancing.
- **Discovery Service (Eureka)**: Service registry allowing microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.
- **Configuration Service (Spring Cloud Config)**: Centralized configuration management for all microservices, supporting environment-specific configurations.

### 3. Business Domain Microservices

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization with:
    - Local authentication using JWT
    - OAuth2 integration for social login options
    - Role-based access control implementation
- **Pet Service**: Core service managing:
    - Pet creation, customization, and management
    - Pet status updates and interactions
    - Pet lifecycle events
- **Payment Service**: Integration with Stripe for:
    - Processing payments for premium features
    - Managing subscriptions
    - Handling payment history and receipts
- **Backoffice Service**: Administrative functionality for:
    - User management
    - System configuration
    - Reporting and analytics

### 4. Observability Infrastructure

- **Observability Stack**: Comprehensive monitoring solution including:
    - Centralized logging with Loki for efficient log aggregation and querying
    - Metrics collection with Prometheus for time-series data monitoring
    - Visualization and dashboards with Grafana for system health monitoring
    - Alerting mechanisms for critical issues and anomaly detection

### 5. Frontend Architecture

- **ReactJS Application**:
    - Component-based UI architecture
    - Redux for state management
    - Responsive design for multiple device support
    - Integration with backend services via API Gateway

### 6. Data Management Strategy

- **Database per Service**: Each microservice will maintain its own database to ensure loose coupling
- **Cache Implementation**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data

#### Event-Driven Architecture

- **Event Communication Patterns**:
  - **Event Sourcing**: Storing state changes as a sequence of events
  - **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separating read and write operations
  - **Choreography-based Service Coordination**: Services react to events rather than being directly commanded
  - **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions across services through events

- **Core Event Types**:
  - **Domain Events**: Representing business-significant occurrences (user registration, pet creation)
  - **Integration Events**: Facilitating communication between bounded contexts
  - **State Transfer Events**: Containing the complete state of an entity
  - **Event Notifications**: Lightweight events indicating something has happened

- **Event Flow Management**:
  - Handling failed event processing
  - Event replay capabilities for system recovery and debugging
  - Preventing duplicate event processing
  - Event versioning strategies for backward/forward compatibility

### 7. Security Implementation

- **API Security**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS attacks
- **Regular Security Audits**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### 8. DevOps & Deployment Strategy

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment with Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all services
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent configurations across development, testing, and production

### 9. Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure setup (API Gateway, Discovery, Config)
- **Phase 1.5**: Event-Driven Communication Infrastructure
  - Event messaging platform setup and configuration
  - Event schema standards establishment
  - Event patterns and standards establishment
  - Integration with existing services
- **Phase 2**: Authentication and Pet services implementation
  - Both services implemented with event-driven communication capabilities
  - Event production and consumption for cross-service interactions
- **Phase 3**: Payment integration and Backoffice service
  - Event-driven integration with existing services
- **Phase 4**: Monitoring infrastructure and frontend development
  - Event system monitoring and management
- **Phase 5**: Integration testing, performance optimization, and security auditing
  - Event flow testing and optimization

### 10. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Service and component level testing
- **Integration Testing**: Testing service interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessments

This comprehensive strategy provides a solid foundation for developing our Virtual Pet application with a modern microservices architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and resilience.
