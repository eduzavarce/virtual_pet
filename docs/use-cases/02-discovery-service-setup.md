# Use Case 02: Discovery Service Setup

## Description
This use case covers the setup and configuration of a service registry using Eureka. The Discovery Service will allow microservices to register themselves and discover other services dynamically, enabling flexible service-to-service communication.

## Actors
- Developer
- System Administrator

## Preconditions
- Spring Cloud dependencies are available
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up a new Eureka Server project
2. Developer configures service health checks to monitor service instances
3. Developer implements service registration for all microservices
4. Developer configures the Discovery Service for high availability
5. Developer implements service metadata to store additional information about services
6. Developer tests service registration and discovery functionality

## Alternative Flows
- If a service instance becomes unhealthy, it should be automatically removed from the registry
- If the Discovery Service itself fails, services should continue to operate with cached service registry information

## Postconditions
- Eureka Server is operational and accepting service registrations
- Microservices can register with the Discovery Service
- Microservices can discover and communicate with other services
- Health checks are properly monitoring service instances
