# Use Case 06: Pet Service

## Description
This use case covers the implementation of the Pet Service, which is the core service of the Virtual Pet application. It manages pet creation, customization, status tracking, interactions, and lifecycle events.

## Actors
- Developer
- User
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services (API Gateway, Discovery, Config) are operational
- Event-driven communication infrastructure is set up
- Keycloak integration is operational
- User Service is operational
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer designs a flexible pet data model to represent various pet types with different attributes
2. Developer implements CRUD operations for virtual pets (create, read, update, delete)
3. Developer implements pet status tracking for health, happiness, and energy levels
4. Developer implements pet interaction mechanics (feeding, playing, etc.)
5. Developer implements pet customization options for appearance and attributes
6. Developer implements pet lifecycle events (birth, growth stages, etc.)
7. Developer implements a notification system for pet status changes
8. Developer configures event publishing for pet creation, status changes, interactions, and lifecycle events
9. Developer implements event consumption from Keycloak and the User Service for user account and profile changes
10. User creates a new virtual pet with desired type and initial attributes
11. User customizes pet's appearance and attributes according to preferences
12. User interacts with pet through various activities to maintain its status
13. User monitors pet's status and health to ensure its well-being
14. User observes pet evolution over time based on interactions
15. User receives notifications when pet needs attention
16. Administrator accesses and manages all pets in the system for troubleshooting and assistance

## Alternative Flows
- If pet creation validation fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If pet status reaches critical levels, urgent notifications should be sent
- If pet interaction is not possible due to status constraints, appropriate feedback should be provided
- If pet customization is not available for certain pet types, appropriate feedback should be provided

## Postconditions
- Users can create, customize, and interact with virtual pets
- Pet status is tracked and updated based on interactions and time
- Pets evolve over time based on care and interactions
- Users receive notifications about pet status changes
- Pet-related events are published for other services to consume
- Administrators can manage all pets in the system
