# Use Case 08: Backoffice Service

## Description
This use case covers the implementation of the Backoffice Service, which provides administrative functionality for user management, system configuration, reporting, and analytics for the Virtual Pet application.

## Actors
- Developer
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services (API Gateway, Discovery, Config) are operational
- Event-driven communication infrastructure is set up
- Keycloak integration is operational
- User Service is operational
- Pet Service is operational
- Payment Service is operational
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer implements a comprehensive user management system for administrators
2. Developer implements system configuration management for adjusting settings without code changes
3. Developer implements reporting and analytics dashboards for platform insights
4. Developer implements audit logging for administrative actions to ensure accountability
5. Developer implements role-based access control for administrative functions
6. Developer implements a notification system for administrators
7. Developer configures event consumption from Keycloak, User Service, Pet Service, and Payment Service
8. Developer configures event publishing for system configuration changes
9. Administrator views comprehensive user information for support purposes
10. Administrator manages user accounts (enable/disable/update) to enforce platform policies
11. Administrator configures system settings to optimize platform behavior
12. Administrator views analytics dashboards for data-driven decision making
13. Administrator generates custom reports for analyzing specific aspects of the platform
14. Administrator views audit logs of administrative actions for tracking changes
15. Administrator manages feature flags and toggles for controlling feature rollout

## Alternative Flows
- If user management operations fail, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If system configuration changes cannot be applied, administrators should be notified with details
- If report generation fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If audit logging fails, the system should attempt to record the failure through alternative means

## Postconditions
- Administrators can view and manage all users in the platform
- Administrators can adjust system settings without code changes
- Administrators can access reporting and analytics dashboards
- All administrative actions are logged for accountability
- Different admin roles have appropriate permissions
- Administrators receive notifications about important system events
- System configuration changes are published for other services to consume
