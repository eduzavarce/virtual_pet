# Use Case 09: Observability Infrastructure

## Description
This use case covers the implementation of the Observability Infrastructure using the Loki-Grafana-Prometheus stack. This infrastructure will provide comprehensive monitoring, logging, metrics collection, visualization, and alerting capabilities for the Virtual Pet application.

## Actors
- Developer
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services are operational
- Business domain microservices are operational
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up Grafana as the central visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces
2. Developer implements Loki for log aggregation and storage from all services
3. Developer sets up Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
4. Developer configures service instrumentation with Prometheus client libraries
5. Developer implements Promtail agents on all service instances for log shipping
6. Developer creates standardized logging patterns across all services
7. Developer implements distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
8. Developer creates custom Grafana dashboards for system overview
9. Developer creates service-specific Grafana dashboards for detailed monitoring
10. Developer implements alerting rules in Grafana for critical issues notification
11. Developer sets up log-based alerts in Loki for error pattern detection
12. Developer implements metric-based alerts in Prometheus for threshold violations
13. Developer creates dashboards for monitoring the event-driven architecture
14. Developer implements monitoring for Kafka performance metrics
15. Developer sets up retention policies for logs and metrics
16. Developer implements user-friendly error tracking and visualization
17. Administrator accesses monitoring dashboards to monitor system health
18. Administrator receives alerts for critical issues
19. Administrator views and analyzes logs across services for troubleshooting
20. Administrator monitors resource usage for scaling and resource planning

## Alternative Flows
- If a service fails to report metrics, the monitoring system should detect and alert on the missing data
- If log shipping fails, local log storage should be used until connectivity is restored
- If alerting system cannot deliver notifications through primary channels, fallback methods should be used
- If visualization components fail, raw data should still be accessible through alternative means

## Postconditions
- Comprehensive monitoring is in place for all services
- Logs from all services are centrally collected and queryable
- System and application metrics are gathered and stored
- Custom dashboards provide visibility into system health and performance
- Alerting is configured for critical issues and anomalies
- Administrators can effectively monitor and troubleshoot the system
