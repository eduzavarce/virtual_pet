# Use Case 10: Frontend Development

## Description
This use case covers the development of the frontend application using ReactJS. The frontend will provide the user interface for the Virtual Pet application, allowing users to interact with their virtual pets and access all application features.

## Actors
- Developer
- User
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Backend microservices are operational
- API Gateway is configured to serve frontend requests
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up the ReactJS application structure for modular and maintainable development
2. Developer implements Redux for predictable state management
3. Developer creates reusable UI components for consistent look and feel
4. Developer implements responsive design principles for multi-device support
5. Developer integrates the frontend with the API Gateway for backend communication
6. Developer implements client-side routing for navigation between application sections
7. Developer implements Keycloak integration for authentication and user registration
8. Developer implements User Service integration for user profile management
9. Developer creates the pet management interface for pet creation and interaction
10. Developer implements the payment and subscription UI for premium features
11. Developer creates an admin dashboard interface for system management
12. Developer implements error handling and user feedback mechanisms
13. Developer implements frontend logging and error tracking
14. Developer optimizes the frontend for performance and responsiveness
15. Developer implements comprehensive frontend testing
16. User accesses the application on different devices with consistent experience
17. User navigates through a visually appealing and intuitive interface
18. User receives visual feedback for actions performed in the application
19. Administrator accesses the comprehensive admin interface for system management

## Alternative Flows
- If the API Gateway is unavailable, the frontend should display appropriate error messages
- If Keycloak authentication fails, clear error messages should guide the user
- If User Service operations fail, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If a feature is not available due to subscription status, appropriate messaging should be shown
- If client-side validation fails, immediate feedback should be provided to the user

## Postconditions
- Frontend application is fully functional and integrated with backend services
- Users can access all application features through an intuitive interface
- The application works consistently across different devices and screen sizes
- Administrators have access to a comprehensive management interface
- Error handling and feedback mechanisms provide clear information to users
