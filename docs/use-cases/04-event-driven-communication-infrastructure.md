# Use Case 04: Event-Driven Communication Infrastructure

## Description
This use case covers the setup and implementation of an event-driven communication infrastructure using Kafka. This infrastructure will enable asynchronous communication between microservices through events, supporting loose coupling and scalability.

## Actors
- Developer
- System Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services (API Gateway, Discovery, Config) are operational
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up a Kafka cluster with appropriate configuration for high availability
2. Developer configures Kafka for fault tolerance to ensure reliable event processing
3. Developer implements a schema registry for event schema versioning and validation
4. Developer sets up Kafka Connect for data integration between Kafka and other systems
5. Developer implements Kafka Streams for complex event processing
6. Developer establishes monitoring and alerting for the Kafka infrastructure
7. Developer implements standardized event schemas for consistent event production and consumption
8. Developer implements event versioning strategies for backward/forward compatibility
9. Developer sets up dead letter queues for handling failed event processing
10. Developer implements event replay capabilities for reprocessing historical events
11. Developer implements event sourcing patterns for state reconstruction from event history
12. Developer implements CQRS patterns for optimizing read and write operations
13. Developer implements idempotent event consumers to prevent duplicate processing

## Alternative Flows
- If a Kafka broker fails, the cluster should continue operating with minimal disruption
- If event processing fails, the event should be sent to a dead letter queue for analysis
- If schema validation fails, appropriate error handling should occur

## Postconditions
- Kafka cluster is operational and properly configured for high availability
- Event schemas are standardized and versioned
- Services can communicate asynchronously through events
- Failed events can be identified and reprocessed
- Event processing is monitored and alerting is in place
