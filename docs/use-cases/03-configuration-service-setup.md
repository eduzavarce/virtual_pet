# Use Case 03: Configuration Service Setup

## Description
This use case covers the setup and configuration of a centralized Configuration Service using Spring Cloud Config. The Configuration Service will provide a central place for managing external properties for all microservices across different environments.

## Actors
- Developer
- System Administrator

## Preconditions
- Spring Cloud dependencies are available
- Development environment is set up
- Git repository for storing configuration files is available

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up a new Spring Cloud Config Server project
2. Developer configures the Config Server to use a Git repository as the configuration store
3. Developer implements environment-specific configurations for different deployment environments
4. Developer sets up encryption for sensitive configuration properties
5. Developer implements configuration refresh capabilities for runtime configuration updates
6. Developer configures fallback configurations for service resilience
7. Developer tests configuration retrieval and refresh functionality

## Alternative Flows
- If the Git repository is unavailable, the Config Server should use cached configurations
- If encryption keys are rotated, the Config Server should handle re-encryption of properties
- If a service cannot connect to the Config Server, it should use local fallback configurations

## Postconditions
- Configuration Server is operational and serving configuration properties
- Microservices can retrieve their configurations from the central server
- Sensitive properties are properly encrypted
- Configuration changes can be applied without service restarts
- Environment-specific configurations are properly managed
