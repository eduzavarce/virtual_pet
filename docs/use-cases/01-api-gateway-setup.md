# Use Case 01: API Gateway Setup

## Description
This use case covers the setup and configuration of a centralized API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway. The API Gateway will serve as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, filtering, load balancing, and security.

## Actors
- Developer
- System Administrator

## Preconditions
- Spring Cloud dependencies are available
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer sets up a new Spring Cloud Gateway project
2. Developer configures routing rules to forward requests to appropriate microservices
3. Developer implements request filtering to block invalid or malicious requests
4. Developer configures load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across service instances
5. Developer implements rate limiting to protect against traffic spikes and DoS attacks
6. Developer configures CORS settings for secure frontend-backend communication
7. Developer implements JWT token validation for authenticated access to protected resources
8. Developer generates OpenAPI documentation for the API Gateway endpoints

## Alternative Flows
- If a microservice is unavailable, the API Gateway should return an appropriate error response
- If rate limits are exceeded, requests should be queued or rejected with appropriate status codes

## Postconditions
- API Gateway is operational and correctly routing requests to microservices
- Security measures (JWT validation, rate limiting) are functioning properly
- API documentation is available for consumers
