# Use Case 05: Keycloak Integration and User Service

## Description
This use case covers the integration of Keycloak as the external identity and access management solution for the Virtual Pet application, as well as the implementation of a separate User Service. Keycloak will handle authentication, authorization, and identity management, while the User Service will manage user-related business logic not directly related to authentication.

## Actors
- Developer
- User
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services (API Gateway, Discovery, Config) are operational
- Event-driven communication infrastructure is set up
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
### Keycloak Integration
1. Developer sets up and configures Keycloak server for the Virtual Pet application
2. Developer configures Keycloak realms, clients, and security settings
3. Developer configures user registration and login flows in Keycloak
4. Developer configures OAuth2/OpenID Connect for social login integration (Google, Facebook)
5. Developer sets up role-based access control (RBAC) in Keycloak
6. Developer configures password policies and recovery mechanisms in Keycloak
7. Developer integrates the API Gateway with Keycloak for token validation and authorization
8. Developer configures event listeners in Keycloak to publish authentication events
9. User registers for a new account through Keycloak's registration page
10. User logs in using username and password through Keycloak
11. User logs in using social media accounts through Keycloak's OAuth2 integration
12. User resets password through Keycloak's password recovery process
13. Administrator manages user accounts and permissions through Keycloak's admin console

### User Service Implementation
14. Developer implements the User Service for managing user profiles and preferences
15. Developer implements user profile management functionality
16. Developer implements user preferences and settings management
17. Developer configures event consumption from Keycloak for user-related events
18. Developer configures event publishing for user profile and preference changes
19. User manages their profile information through the User Service
20. User configures their preferences and settings through the User Service

## Alternative Flows
### Keycloak Integration
- If Keycloak registration validation fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If Keycloak authentication fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If password reset is requested, Keycloak will send a secure link to the user's email
- If token refresh fails, the user should be redirected to Keycloak login

### User Service
- If user profile update fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If user preferences cannot be saved, the system should retry or notify the user
- If event consumption from Keycloak fails, the User Service should implement retry mechanisms

## Postconditions
### Keycloak Integration
- Keycloak is properly configured and integrated with the Virtual Pet application
- Users can securely register for new accounts through Keycloak
- Users can authenticate using username/password or social login through Keycloak
- Users can maintain their session through Keycloak token refresh
- Users can recover their accounts through Keycloak's password reset functionality
- Administrators can manage user accounts and permissions through Keycloak's admin console
- Authentication events from Keycloak are published for other services to consume

### User Service
- User Service is properly implemented and integrated with Keycloak
- Users can manage their profiles through the User Service
- Users can configure their preferences and settings through the User Service
- User profile and preference changes are published as events for other services to consume
- User Service consumes relevant events from Keycloak and other services
