# Use Case 05: Authentication Service

## Description
This use case covers the implementation of the Authentication Service, which handles user registration, authentication, authorization, and account management. The service will provide secure access control for the Virtual Pet application.

## Actors
- Developer
- User
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- Core infrastructure services (API Gateway, Discovery, Config) are operational
- Event-driven communication infrastructure is set up
- Development environment is set up

## Main Flow
1. Developer implements a secure user registration system with proper validation and password encryption
2. Developer implements JWT-based authentication for secure user login and session management
3. Developer implements token refresh mechanisms for maintaining user sessions
4. Developer integrates OAuth2 authentication with popular social platforms (Google, Facebook)
5. Developer implements role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
6. Developer implements secure password reset functionality for account recovery
7. Developer configures event publishing for user registration, authentication, and role changes
8. Developer implements event consumption for relevant system-wide changes
9. User registers for a new account with username, password, and required information
10. User logs in using username and password to receive JWT token
11. User logs in using social media accounts through OAuth2 integration
12. User resets password through secure password recovery process
13. Administrator manages user accounts and permissions through administrative interface

## Alternative Flows
- If registration validation fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If authentication fails, appropriate error messages should be displayed
- If password reset is requested, a secure link should be sent to the user's email
- If token refresh fails, the user should be redirected to login

## Postconditions
- Users can securely register for new accounts
- Users can authenticate using username/password or social login
- Users can maintain their session through token refresh
- Users can recover their accounts through password reset
- Administrators can manage user accounts and permissions
- Authentication events are published for other services to consume
