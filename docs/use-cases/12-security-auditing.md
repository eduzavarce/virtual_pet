# Use Case 12: Security Auditing

## Description
This use case covers the implementation of comprehensive security auditing for the Virtual Pet application. It ensures that the system is protected against security vulnerabilities and that proper security practices are followed throughout the development and operation of the application.

## Actors
- Security Engineer
- Developer
- Administrator

## Preconditions
- All microservices are implemented and operational
- Frontend application is developed
- CI/CD pipeline is established
- Development, testing, and production environments are set up

## Main Flow
1. Security Engineer conducts vulnerability assessments for all services
2. Security Engineer implements automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
3. Security Engineer conducts penetration testing on the system
4. Developer implements secure coding practices and reviews
5. Developer implements comprehensive Keycloak authentication and authorization testing
6. Developer implements User Service security testing
7. Developer implements data encryption auditing
8. Developer implements API security testing
9. Developer implements security logging and monitoring
10. Administrator accesses security audit reports
11. Administrator implements security incident response procedures
12. Security Engineer performs regular security reviews and updates
13. Developer addresses identified security vulnerabilities
14. Developer implements security patches and updates
15. Security Engineer verifies remediation of security issues
16. Administrator conducts security awareness training for the team
17. Security Engineer performs compliance checks against security standards
18. Developer implements security controls based on threat modeling
19. Security Engineer conducts code security reviews
20. Developer implements secure configuration management
21. Administrator establishes and enforces security policies

## Alternative Flows
- If critical vulnerabilities are discovered, emergency patching procedures should be initiated
- If security scanning tools produce false positives, manual verification should be conducted
- If security incidents occur, the incident response plan should be activated
- If compliance requirements change, security controls should be updated accordingly

## Postconditions
- All services are assessed for security vulnerabilities
- Automated security scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
- Penetration testing is conducted regularly
- Secure coding practices are followed throughout the codebase
- Keycloak authentication and authorization mechanisms are thoroughly tested
- User Service security is thoroughly tested
- Data encryption is properly implemented and audited
- API endpoints are protected against common attacks
- Security logging and monitoring is in place
- Security audit reports are available to administrators
- Security incident response procedures are established
